# Python ATM Simulator: Building a Secure and Efficient Automated Teller Machine
# This project is a Python-based ATM simulator that emulates the functionalities of 
# a real automated teller machine. The code provides a simplified version of an ATM system
# with features such as authentication, balance checking, withdrawal, and deposit.

# The ATM simulator utilizes a dictionary data structure to store account information,
# including account numbers, associated PINs, and balances. Upon running the program, 
# users are prompted to enter their account number and PIN for authentication. If the entered 
# credentials match an existing account, the user gains access to the available options.

# The main menu presents the following choices:
# Check Balance: This option allows the user to view their current account balance.
# Withdraw: Users can specify the amount they wish to withdraw. If the account has sufficient funds, 
# the withdrawal is processed, and the new balance is displayed. Otherwise, an insufficient 
# balance message is shown.
# Deposit: Users can deposit a specified amount into their account. The deposited amount is added to the account balance, and the updated balance is displayed.
# Exit: Choosing this option allows the user to exit the ATM simulator.
# The project emphasizes security by requiring an account number and a PIN for authentication.
# If the entered credentials do not match any existing account, an error message is displayed.

# By exploring this Python ATM simulator project, you can gain hands-on experience in building a console-based application,
# managing account data using dictionaries, implementing user authentication, and performing banking operations such as balance checking, withdrawal, and deposit.
